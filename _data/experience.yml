- company: Universidade Federal de Alagoas (Federal University of Alagoas)
  position: Scientific initiation researcher
  duration: Jul, 2015 &mdash; Jul, 2018
  summary: I worked as scientific researcher on the areas of data science and cloud computing systems. During this period I had focus on four main projects as listed below:<ul class="resume-item-list"><li>An approach to use genetic algorithms to optimize the configuration parameters on Hadoop based systems</li><li>A tool to extract data from the brazilian public health system, focusing on a lung cancer database. For this I used a Hadoop implementation in R language which goes by the name of Rhipe.</li><li>The creation and prototype implementation of a modular system and business model for cloud-based services. For this I used a stack-like model where the service was subdivided by "modules" like Infraestructure provider, Billing management, Data Manager and the user interface. At the end we managed to have a prototype where one could couple ou decouple those modules and build cloud services the way they like, changing the billing model, storage servers or stuff like that just like using building blocks.</li><li>The implementation of the cloud distributed version of a delegated machine learning algorithm in Julia language. This work was done in partneship with Pontífica Universidad Católica de Valparaíso on Chile. They invited me to visit them and implement the code. To acomplish this goal I've managed to create a virtualization software layer to deploy cloud servers using Docker from within the Julia code implementation. With those servers online, I used them to simulate the independent nodes the algorithm takes leverage in order to perform it's distributed convolution </li></ul>
